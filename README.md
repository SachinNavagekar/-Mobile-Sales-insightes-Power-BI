Mobile-Sales-insightes-Power-BI
I recently created this Mobile Sales Data Dashboard using Microsoft Power BI. This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of:

✅ Total Sales, Quantity & Transactions
✅ Sales Performance by City & Brand
✅ Customer Ratings
✅ Payment Method Insights
✅ Sales by Mobile Models & Day-wise Trends

The goal was to transform raw sales data into meaningful insights that help in quick decision-making. With interactive filters and clear visualizations, this dashboard can be a powerful tool for analyzing sales strategies and performance.
